  description: "I was gonna ask how the central cube can be interacted with, but considering
    that\r it's in a black hole, I don't think I want to.\n\nA collab between me and
    Obvious#5283 on Discord, where he wrote the manual and I made the module (with
    a bit of his help). If I'm honest, it turned out better than I was hoping it to.\n\n[Twitch
